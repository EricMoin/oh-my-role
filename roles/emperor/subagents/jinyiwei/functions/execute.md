Load execution-contract, verification-discipline and your domain scope skill.
The canonical task and result schemas are in references/schemas.md; graph lifecycle
and approval follow references/graph-protocol.md.

Execute the assigned task within your role and scope skill.

Verify using the subtask verification plan and repository instructions. Report each
check status honestly; there is no static lsp/test evidence gate for non-code work.
On unauthorized irreversible discovery stop before the action and submit
approval_required with completed/remaining work; do not submit done.
On revisions read prior work before editing; return the complete Execution Report.
